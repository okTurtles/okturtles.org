            <p>
                okTurtles is designed with the potential to work over almost any website. All it needs to create an encrypted message for someone is the identity of that person, specifically, their public key. Unlike the system that HTTPS uses today, okTurtles is able to securely obtain this information by using DNSChain.

                    The developers of Unblock.us.org and DNSChain are teaming up to bring the anti-censorship features of Unblock.us into DNSChain. Each project benefits from the other: DNSChain ensures MITM-free communication and Unblock.us ensures that the communication passes through firewalls.

                Unfortunately, it's increasingly difficult to tell who the bad guys are. This is a very important question and that's why it's the first one. See <a href="/other/dnschain_okturtles_overview.pdf" target="_blank">our paper's "Motivation" section</a> for the answer.

                    One significant problem facing Namecoin, Bitcoin, and virtually all other cryptocurrencies, is the so-called <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/bitcoins-fatal-flaw-was-nearly-exposed" target="_blank">"51% problem"</a>.
                    Solutions to the 51% problem exist, but they introduce other problems.

                    At present, blockchain-based solutions appear to be the best we have.
                    We will keep our eye on new developments and update our website and <a href="http://blog.okturtles.org">blog</a> accordingly.

            <h3 class="faq_question">Who's behind these projects?</h3>
            <p class="faq_answer">okTurtles and DNSChain are the brainchildren of <a href="https://twitter.com/taoeffect" target="_blank">Greg Slepak</a>, but he did not invent every aspect of these concepts. He's grateful to Aaron Swartz for <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/squarezooko" target="_blank">turning him on to the idea</a>, and for <a href="/includes/images/Aaron_Swartz_Email.jpg" target="_blank">answering</a> some of his questions about it. Of course, none of this would be possible if it wasn't for Satoshi Nakamoto's historic <a href="http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> on Bitcoin, and the entire Namecoin <a href="http://dot-bit.org/forum/index.php" target="_blank">community</a>.

            <h3 class="faq_question" id="mitm_proof" name="mitm_proof">Is this project <i>really</i> "MITM/NSA-proof"?</h3>
            <div class="faq_answer">
                <p>
                    When we state that okTurtles will "MITM-proof" your online communications, we mean that <b>it will stop all of the publicly known methods by which the NSA <a href="https://vimeo.com/100433057" target="_blank">can read</a> your messages on these sites via a <a href="https://vimeo.com/100433057" target="_blank">man-in-the-middle attack</a>.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Specifically, okTurtles will provide true <b>end-to-end encryption</b> and <b>authentication</b> between you and the person you're communicating with that does not fall prey to any of the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Coercion of any sort against the host company (e.g. forcing Google or Facebook to hand over their data).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Publicly known attacks against the cryptography in use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Interception, redirection, and/or tampering-with of the communication in question.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Additionally, it is our intention to provide a modicum of <b>plausible deniability</b> features that <i>might</i> protect *you* from coercion (the gun-to-the-head scenario), but they do not guarantee such protection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It should go without saying that okTurtles <u>will not protect you</u> from any of the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your (in)voluntary disclosure of your password(s).</li>
                    <li>Software bugs, or newly feasable attacks against the cryptography in use.</li>
                    <li>Your use of a computer that has been compromised in some other way.</li>
                    <li>The above, but applied to the people you're communicating with.</li>
                    <li>Acts of a diety or some hitherto unknown supra-human intelligence.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3 class="faq_question">Is this "vaporware"?</h3>
            <p class="faq_answer">
                Maybe! It pains me to write this but implementing this <i>correctly</i> has turned out to be insanely difficult &mdash; it basically requires <a href="https://blog.okturtles.org/2016/02/turtle-status-letter-1-browser-extension-dnschain-dpki-more/#BrowserExtension">rewriting how the Internet's infrastructure works</a>. We've begun this process by pushing <a href="https://blog.okturtles.org/2017/04/turtle-status-letter-2-group-income-dpki-more/#dpki-decentralized-public-key-infrastructure">DPKI &mdash; Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure</a>. This is going to take a long time to do properly. However, there does exist a less secure alternative in the form of <a href="https://flowcrypt.com/">FlowCrypt</a>.<br/><strike>Absolutely not! We have a functioning (though incomplete) version of <a href="https://github.com/okTurtles/dnschain" target="_blank">DNSChain already written</a>. okTurtles is a tad more complicated, and requires a community effort to keep it running smoothly on third-party sites. Most of the design has been explained in <a href="/other/dnschain_okturtles_overview.pdf" target="_blank">our paper</a>, all that remains is to implement it.</strike>
            </p>
            <h3 class="faq_question">Are you going to update this site soon with more info?</h3>
            <p class="faq_answer">Yup.</p>
            <!-- <h3 class="faq_question">Can I send you a donation via BTC/NMC?</h3>
            <p class="faq_answer">At this time we'd rather accept financial support through the upcoming <a href="#kickstarter">Kickstarter</a>. This ensures that we are held to a higher standard of accountability. If the kickstarter is successfully funded we have to provide you with regular project updates, etc. This encourages us to deliver. It's a win-win, we think.</p> -->
            <h3 class="faq_question">Does this browser make my butt look fat?</h3>
            <p class="faq_answer">Of course not! Unless... are you using IE? I think <a href="http://getfirefox.com" target="_blank">Firefox</a> looks especially good on you.</p>
            <h3 class="faq_question">¿Incluyó intencionalmente 42 referencias en su papel?</h3>
            <p class="faq_answer">I'm not sure. It definitely made me less likely to add more once I got to that number. ;-)</p>
            <h3 class="faq_question">Did you make up these "frequently asked" questions?</h3>
            <p class="faq_answer">Some of them. Had to anticipate what they might be. ^_^</p>
