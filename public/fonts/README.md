# License

Mark Simonson generously donated a single non-commercial license to the okTurtles Foundation to allow the use of [his wonderful Proxima Nova font](http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/proxima-nova) in the styles of Bold, Light, Regular, Regular Italic, and Thin.

This is means:

1. The fonts in this folder are __his__, he owns the copyright to them, and they are protected by United States copyright laws and international treaty provisions.
2. You may not use these fonts unless you own a license to them.
3. This folder __is not__ where you should obtain his font from. Instead, [see the options listed on his website](http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/proxima-nova).
4. Our license is __non-transferable,__ meaning, we cannot grant any rights to these fonts to a third-party, so don't ask!
