<ol>
<li>
<strong>Annual Meeting.</strong> The date of the regular annual meeting 
shall be set by the Board of Directors of the okTurtles Foundation, who 
shall also set the time and place.</li>
<li>
<strong>Special Meetings.</strong> Special meetings may be called by any
 officer of the okTurtles Foundation, or any member of the board of 
directors at any time, provided calling of such a meeting complies with 
notice requirements articulated below.</li>

<strong>Notice.</strong> Notice of each meeting shall be given three days in advance of that meeting.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Board Role, Size, Compensation.</strong> The board of directors 
shall have three members. The size of the board of directors may be 
amended from time to time as best serves the interests of the okTurtles 
Foundation, provided such amendments are in compliance with applicable 
state law.</li>
<li>
<strong>Meetings.</strong> The board shall meet annually at an agreed upon time and place.</li>
<li>
<strong>Board Elections.</strong> Election of new directors will occur 
as the first item of business at the annual meeting of the okTurtles 
Foundation, or at special meetings in order to fill a vacancy. Directors
 will be elected by a unanimous vote of the current directors whenever 
there are three acting directors, otherwise, if more than three acting 
directors are on the board, a majority vote is required.</li>
<li>
<strong>Terms.</strong> Unless board members resign, terms of office 
shall be for life. If there comes a time when there is substantial 
public interest in serving on the board of the okTurtles Foundation, 
this section may be amended by two-thirds majority vote to limit terms, 
or subject board members to annual election, as the then board of 
directors sees fit.</li>
<li>
<strong>Quorum.</strong> A majority of the board members must be in 
attendance before business can be transacted or motions made or passed. 
Attendance may be in person, via phone, or by some other electronic 
method.</li>
<li>
<strong>Notice.</strong> An official board meeting requires that each 
board member have notice of the meeting given at least three days in 
advance of that meeting. A waiver signed by a person entitled to notice 
shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of notice, but shall only be 
valid for items on the proposed agenda. A person's attendance at a 
meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of that meeting, except
 when the person objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the 
transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully called 
or convened.</li>
<li>
<strong>Officers and Duties.</strong>

<li>Officers: There shall be four officers of the board: a president, 
chairman, vice president and secretary. One board member may serve in 
one, some, or all of these capacities so long as doing so does not 
conflict with state law.</li>
<li>Duties: Officer duties are as follows: The president, chairman, 
secretary or treasurer may preside or arrange for other directors to 
preside at each meeting in the following order: president, chairman, 
secretary, treasurer and other members. The president, chairman, 
secretary, treasurer or other board members may chair committees on 
special subjects as designated by the board. The secretary shall be 
responsible for keeping records of board actions, including overseeing 
the taking of minutes at all board meetings, sending out meeting 
announcements, distributing copies of minutes and the agenda to each 
board member, and assuring that corporate records are maintained. Any 
officer listed herein may delegate this duty to any other board member 
who consents to accept it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Vacancies.</strong> When a vacancy on the board exists, 
nominations for new members may be received from present board members 
by the president, chairman, secretary or treasurer within ten working 
days in advance of a board meeting. Board members shall be given three 
days advance notice of any nominations to be voted upon at the next 
board meeting. If events transpire such that there is only one director 
on the board of directors, that director may unilaterally appoint a 
second director. If events transpire such that there are no directors in
 office, the current volunteers and employees as well as the present and
 past presidents of the okTurtles Foundation may, by majority of those 
voting, elect one director.</li>
<li>
<strong>Resignation, Termination and Absences.</strong> Resignation from
 the board must be in writing and received by the secretary or tendered 
at a board meeting. A board member may be removed by a two-thirds vote 
of the remaining directors where such removal is deemed by the voting 
directors to be in the best interests of the okTurtles Foundation and 
where such removal does not conflict with any applicable law.</li>
<li>
<strong>Special Meetings.</strong> Special meetings of the Board shall 
be called upon the request of the president, vice-president, secretary, 
treasurer or any other board member. Special meetings require three days
 advance notice. A waiver signed by a person entitled to notice shall be
 deemed equivalent to the giving of notice, but shall only be valid for 
items on the proposed agenda. A person's attendance at a meeting shall 
also constitute a waiver of notice of that meeting, except when the 
person objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of 
any business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.</li>

<ol>
<li>The board may create committees as needed. The board may appoint any
 individuals it deems appropriate to such committees without regard to 
age. Appointments shall be by majority vote of the board. Committees may
 be convened prior to the annual meeting by any officer of the okTurtles
 Foundation without calling a meeting of the board. Committees created 
in this fashion are subject to ratification by a majority of the board 
members present at the next annual meeting. The president, chairman, 
secretary or treasurer may appoint committee chairs. In the event of 
disagreement, the choice of officers in the order listed shall take 
priority.</li>

Foundation serve as the members of the executive committee. Except for 
the power to amend the articles of incorporation and bylaws, the

board of directors in the intervals between meetings of the board of 
directors, subject to the direction and control of the board of 
directors.</li>

<p>The okTurtles Foundation shall, to the extent legally permissible, 
indemnify each person who may serve or who has served at any time as an 
officer, director, or employee of the corporation against all expenses 
and liabilities, including, without limitation, counsel fees, judgments,
 fines, excise taxes, penalties and settlement payments, reasonably 
incurred by or imposed upon such person in connection with any 
threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding in which 
he or she may become involved by reason of his or her service in such 
capacity; provided that no indemnification shall be provided for any 
such person with respect to any matter as to which he or she shall have 
been finally adjudicated in any proceeding not to have acted in good 
faith in the reasonable belief that such action was in the best 
interests of the corporation; and further provided that any compromise 
or settlement payment shall be approved by a majority vote of a quorum 
of directors who are not at that time parties to the proceeding.</p>

<p>The indemnification provided hereunder shall inure to the benefit of 
the heirs, executors and administrators of persons entitled to 
indemnification hereunder. The right of indemnification under this 
Article shall be in addition to and not exclusive of all other rights to
 which any person may be entitled.</p>

<p>No amendment or repeal of the provisions of this Article which 
adversely affects the right of an indemnified person under this Article 
shall apply to such person with respect to those acts or omissions which
 occurred at any time prior to such amendment or repeal, unless such 
amendment or repeal was voted by or was made with the written consent of
 such indemnified person. This Article constitutes a contract between 
the corporation and the indemnified officers, directors, employees and 
volunteers. No amendment or repeal of the provisions of this Article 
which adversely affects the right of an indemnified officer, director, 
employee or volunteer under this Article shall apply to such officer, 
director, employee or volunteer with respect to those acts or omissions 
which occurred at any time prior to such amendment or repeal.</p>

<a name="section-i-purpose"></a><a id="user-content-section-i-purpose" class="anchor" href="#section-i-purpose" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Section I: Purpose</h3>

<p>The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect the 
interest of this tax-exempt organization (the okTurtles Foundation) when
 it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that 
might benefit the private interest of an officer or director of the 
Organization or might result in a possible excess benefit transaction. 
This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable 
state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to 
nonprofit and charitable organizations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Interested Person: Any director, principal officer, or member of a 
committee with governing board delegated powers, who has a direct or 
indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an interested person.</li>
<li>Financial Interest: A person has a financial interest if the person 
has, directly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family:

<ul>
<li>An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the Organization has a transaction or arrangement,</li>
<li>A compensation arrangement with the Organization or with any entity 
or individual with which the Organization has a transaction or 
arrangement, or</li>
<li>A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation 
arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the Organization 
is negotiating a transaction or arrangement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration, as well as gifts or favors that are not insubstantial.</p>

<p>A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest. Under
 Section III, Subsection 2, a person who has a financial interest may 
have a conflict of interest only if the appropriate governing board or 
committee decides that a conflict of interest exists.</p>

<a name="section-iii-procedures"></a><a id="user-content-section-iii-procedures" class="anchor" href="#section-iii-procedures" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Section III: Procedures</h3>

<ol>
<li>Duty to Disclose.
In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an 
interested person must disclose the existence of the financial interest 
and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the 
directors and members of committees with governing board delegated 
powers considering the proposed transaction or arrangement.</li>
<li>Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists.
After disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts, and 
after any discussion with the interested person, he/she shall leave the 
governing board or committee meeting while the determination of a 
conflict of interest is discussed and voted upon. The remaining board or
 committee members shall decide if a conflict of interest exists.</li>
<li>Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest:

<ul>
<li>An interested person may make a presentation at the governing board 
or committee meeting, but after the presentation, he/she shall leave the
 meeting during the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or 
arrangement involving the possible conflict of interest.</li>
<li>The chairperson of the governing board or committee shall, if 
appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate 
alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement.</li>
<li>After exercising due diligence, the governing board or committee 
shall determine whether the Organization can obtain with reasonable 
efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or 
entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest.</li>
<li>If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably 
possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the 
governing board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the 
disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the
 Organization's best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is 
fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above determination it shall
 make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or 
arrangement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy:

<ul>
<li>If the governing board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a
 member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest,
 it shall inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the 
member an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose. </li>
<li>If, after hearing the member's response and after making further 
investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the governing board or 
committee determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or 
possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary 
and corrective action.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>To ensure the Organization operates in a manner consistent with 
charitable purposes and does not engage in activities that could 
jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. 
The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following 
subjects:</p>

<ol>
<li>Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based
 on competent survey information, and the result of arm's length 
bargaining.</li>
<li>Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with 
management organizations conform to the Organization's written policies,
 are properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for 
goods and services, further charitable purposes and do not result in 
inurement, impermissible private benefit or in an excess benefit 
transaction.</li>
