<p>A good position statement should be a few paragraphs (between 500 and 1000 words) and should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your background in blockchain or Web technologies</li>
<li>What topic you would like to lead discussion on, including concrete ideas on how this topic relates directly to the Web or browser-facing features</li>
<li>Links to related supporting resources</li>
<li>Any other topics you think the workshop should cover in order to be effective</li>
<li>A focus on technical issues, not process or platform preference. We plan to talk about the what, not the how.</li>

<h2 id="decentralized-public-key-infrastructure-for-blockchains">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure for Blockchains</h2>
<p>Blockchains provide the web with new opportunities. Of course, these include new ways of doing payments, but for this event I would like to suggest as a topic of focus the opportunities that they offer for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixing the lackluster security of Internet connections and communications</li>
<li>Putting users back in control of their digital identities</li>
</ul>
<p>The decentralized and economic nature of blockchains is what gives them their unique security properties; however, on its own this is not enough to make them useful for the web.</p>
<p>For blockchain technology to be useful for the web, it must be possible for any device to store and retrieve data <em>securely</em> from any blockchain, and without resorting to centralized means of doing so, as that would completely undermine their usefulness.</p>
<p>This can be done through the creation of a standardized, blockchain-agnostic protocol for the management of public/private keys that are associated with human-readable identifiers. At the &quot;Rebooting the Web-of-Trust&quot; designshops,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I worked with Vitalik Buterin, Drummon Reed, Jude Nelson, Markus Sabadello, and several others to outline exactly such a protocol, called <em>DPKI</em>, or <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">&quot;Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>DPKI describes how the security of websites and information in general can be significantly improved by fixing the issues that exist in the web's authentication mechanism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509 PKIX</a>.</p>
<p>DPKI focuses on the general problem of securing <em>the data</em> that's associated with <em>global identifiers</em> (such as <code>w3c.com</code>) in a reliable manner, and it focuses on blockchains and their corresponding <em>thin client protocols</em> as promising candidates for solving this problem.</p>
<p>Specifically, it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calls for the creation of a standardized approach by which any device could access the data within any decentralized datastore (typically, a blockchain) using the <em>most secure means appropriate for that blockchain and that device.</em></li>
<li>Describes how the management of decentralized identities, namespaces, and the public/private keys could be handled.</li>
<li>Describes the means by which both identities and private keys could be recovered in the event of loss or compromise.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is this topic area that I believe would be of great interest and relevance to the W3C and this particular event.</p>
<h2 id="relevant-background-for-this-event">Relevant background for this event</h2>
<p>I first became interested in blockchains in 2010 when I encountered Satoshi's Bitcoin whitepaper. Then in 2011, <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/squarezooko">Aaron Swartz's writings</a> helped turn my attention to Namecoin. So I <a href="https://okturtles.com/includes/images/Aaron_Swartz_Email.jpg">reached out to him</a>, offering to help with his idea of building a <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/uncensor">&quot;Censorship resistant web&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>However, my life went in a different direction for a few years and I did not return to this topic area until 2013, after Aaron took his life. In 2013, I'd returned to the University of Florida to finish my final year after taking some time off. The news of Aaron's passing jerked my attention back to that discussion we had, and I decided to return to the censorship problem in earnest.</p>
<p>That year I dived into Namecoin and specifically the problem of making Namecoin accessible on all devices while preserving its security properties. That mission led to the creation of a non-profit called the <a href="https://okturtles.org">okTurtles Foundation</a>, the release of <a href="https://github.com/okTurtles/dnschain">DNSChain</a> (a secure bridge to Namecoin), and <a href="https://okturtles.com/browser-extension/">a vision</a> for how secure communication could be done over any website using these technologies, as well as a way that these techniques could also be used with other techniques <a href="https://github.com/okTurtles/dnschain/blob/master/docs/What-is-it.md#Censorship">to unblock censored websites</a>.</p>
<p>This vision was presented at the 2014 SOUPS conference for the <a href="https://blog.okturtles.org/2014/07/okturtles-demo-at-soups-2014-eff-cup-crypto-usability-prize/">&quot;EFF CUP Crypto Usability Prize&quot;</a>, and it received <a href="https://github.com/okTurtles/dnschain/blob/master/README.md#other-resources">a lot of attention</a> on news media and social networking websites, as well as partnerships and collaborations with various groups working on the same or related areas (OpenBazaar, Namecoin, Onename/Blockstack, IPFS Protocol Labs, and others).</p>
<p>The work I did through the okTurtles Foundation contributed or helped inspire a variety of off-shoot projects and endeavors such as the <a href="https://github.com/okTurtles/blockchainid">Blockchain ID specification</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/okTurtles/openname-specifications/blob/resolvers/resolvers.md">Openname Resolver Specification</a> (now found on <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/blockchain-id/wiki/Resolvers">Blockstack's wiki</a>), and others. The foundation has also served as an outlet for a wide variety of educational content on technical topics related to blockchains and decentralization. Some of this material I taught as a visiting instructor to students at <a href="http://blockchainu.co">Blockchain University</a>.</p>
<p>This work led to my participation at the first <a href="http://www.weboftrust.info/event-2015-sf">&quot;Rebooting the Web-of-Trust&quot; designshop</a> in San Francisco on November 2015 (<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/">github</a>) where I worked with a few others on <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI)</a>.</p>
