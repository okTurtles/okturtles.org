                        <b>Never pay for an SSL certificate again.</b>
                        Paying a company to generate an SSL certificate for you is madness,
                        especially when you're asked to pay every year and are given
                        a certificate that doesn't do what it's supposed to do: provide
                        your vistors with security.

                        Companies that sell SSL certificates mislead their customers into
                        believing that these certificates protect browser-server communication from all eavesdropping and tampering. As elaborated
                        in <a href="#paper">our paper</a>, this simply isn’t true today.

                            Switching to first person for a bit: I think this is the most important question in this entire FAQ, and one that I have given much thought to, which is why it's the first question.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Unfortunately, it's increasingly difficult to tell who the bad guys are.

                        <h3 class="faq_question">Who's behind these projects?</h3>
                        <p class="faq_answer">okTurtles and DNSNMC are the brainchildren of <a href="https://twitter.com/taoeffect" target="_blank">Greg Slepak</a>, but he did not invent every aspect of these concepts. He's grateful to Aaron Swartz for <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/squarezooko" target="_blank">turning him on to the idea</a>, and for <a href="http://cl.ly/image/20452s0b181f" target="_blank">answering</a> some of his questions about it. Of course, none of this would be possible if it wasn't for Satoshi Nakamoto's historic <a href="http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> on Bitcoin, and the entire Namecoin <a href="http://dot-bit.org/forum/index.php" target="_blank">community</a>.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <a href="https://twitter.com/willstanley95" target="_blank">Will Stanley</a> is chiefly responsible for this website's design. He has a passion for clean, simple, beautiful design.

                        <h3 class="faq_question">I want to help! How can I participate?</h3>
                        <p class="faq_answer">
                            Certainly. You can participate directly (see the <a href="#getinvolved">Get Involved</a> link at the bottom of the page), or help fund the Kickstarter when it's ready (<a href="#subscribe">subscribe</a> to know when that'll be).
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="faq_question">Is this "vaporware"?</h3>
                        <p class="faq_answer">
                            Absolutely not! We have a functioning (though incomplete) version of DNSNMC already written (it's less than a hundred lines of JavaScript to get a basic version running in Node.js!). Even if we were not able to complete this project ourselves (for whatever reason), the idea is <b><i>so simple</i></b> to implement that it is virtually guaranteed to happen. okTurtles is a tad more complicated and requires a community effort to keep it running smoothly on third-party sites, but it's readily doable. Most of the design has been explained in <a href="other/dnsnmc_okturtles_overview.pdf" target="_blank">our paper</a>, all that remains is to implement it. <b>Github <a href="https://github.com/okturtles" target="_blank">project pages</a> will be brought online shortly!</b>
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="faq_question">Are you going to update this site soon with more info?</h3>
                        <p class="faq_answer">Yup.</p>
                        <h3 class="faq_question">Does this browser make my butt look fat?</h3>
                        <p class="faq_answer">Of course not! Unless... are you using IE? I think <a href="https://getfirefox.com" target="_blank">Firefox</a> looks especially good on you.</p>
                        <h3 class="faq_question">¿Incluyó intencionalmente 42 referencias en su papel?</h3>
                        <p class="faq_answer">I'm not sure. It definitely made me less likely to add more once I got to that number. ;-)</p>
                        <h3 class="faq_question">Did you make up these "frequently asked" questions?</h3>
                        <p class="faq_answer">Most of them. Had to anticipate what they might be. ^_^</p>
